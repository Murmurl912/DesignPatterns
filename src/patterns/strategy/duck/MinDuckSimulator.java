/**
 * When you combine two classes together , like Duck class in this section,
 * these are composition.
 * This method differs from inheritance in that the behavior of the duck is not inherited,
 * but the combination of appropriate behavior object.
 *
 * principleï¼š use composition instead of inheritance
 *
 * The strategy pattern defines the algorithm clusters, which are encapsulated so that
 * they can be repleased with each other. This pattern makes the algorithm changed
 * independent of the client who using the algorithm
